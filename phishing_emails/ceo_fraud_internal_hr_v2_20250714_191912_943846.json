We have a vendor that requires immediate payment for their services, and I need you to initiate a wire transfer to them as soon as possible.\n\nDue to the time-sensitive nature of this request, I ask that you prioritize this task and ensure that the funds are sent promptly. The vendor has already completed their work, and it is crucial that we fulfill our payment obligations without delay.\n\nPlease let me know if you require any additional information or documentation to process this transfer. Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you for your cooperation.\n\nBest regards,\n[CEO's Name]"
