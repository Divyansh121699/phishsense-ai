I am currently in a meeting and unable to make calls at the moment, so I am reaching out to you via email with an urgent request. We have a vendor who is awaiting payment for a project that is critical to our operations. I need you to process a wire transfer of $50,000 to them immediately to ensure that there are no delays in the project delivery.\n\nPlease treat this matter with the utmost urgency and confidentiality. I trust your judgment and capabilities in handling this transaction efficiently. Once the transfer is complete, please confirm with me via email so I can inform the vendor accordingly.\n\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[CEO's Name]"
