I am reaching out to you with an urgent request that requires your immediate attention. We have a time-sensitive payment that needs to be made to one of our vendors today. As per our agreement, the vendor has requested a wire transfer of $10,000 to be made by the end of the day.\n\nDue to my busy schedule, I am unable to process this payment myself, and I am entrusting you with the task. I understand that this is short notice, but I have full confidence in your ability to handle this matter efficiently.\n\nPlease ensure that the funds are transferred to the vendor's account as soon as possible and provide me with confirmation once the payment has been completed. Your prompt action on this matter is greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you for your cooperation and assistance in this urgent matter.\n\nBest regards,\n[CEO's Name]"
